5. Data Structures
The books will be represented by a book class object. All of the book objects will be stored within a Hash Map

6. Synchronization Policies
This program uses Java's ConcurrentHashMap data structure to store the book objects. The ConcurrentHashMap only allows one PUT operation to run at a time, and does not restrict the use of GET operations.
